# LLM Smoke Test Framework

An AI-powered framework for automatically generating smoke tests for web applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision capabilities.

## Overview

This framework uses OpenAI's language models (like GPT-4o-mini) to analyze webpages and generate comprehensive smoke test scripts in Cucumber format. It can:

- Crawl single pages or entire websites
- Analyze page structure using both DOM analysis and vision capabilities
- Generate Cucumber feature files, step definitions, and page objects
- Record and incorporate user flows for more accurate tests
- Process and analyze screenshots for better visual understanding

## Key Features

- **Multi-mode Analysis**: Combines traditional DOM analysis with vision-powered screenshot analysis
- **User Flow Integration**: Records and analyzes successful user interactions to generate more realistic tests
- **Site-Wide Testing**: Crawls entire websites and generates cohesive test suites
- **Visual Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o-mini's vision capabilities to analyze page layouts and visual elements
- **Adaptive Test Generation**: Tailors tests to specific page types (login, form, landing, etc.)
- **Flexible Output**: Generates tests in Cucumber format with Java implementations (extensible to other languages)
